**Supervise Learning  Project;**

_**Part 1: Predicting Patient Condition from Biomechanics Features**_

_Data Preparation:_

* Read three CSV files as DataFrames and store them separately.
* Print the shape, columns, and data types of each DataFrame.
* Compare column names across DataFrames and note any differences.
* Unify variations in the 'Class' feature across DataFrames.
* Combine all three DataFrames into a single DataFrame.
* Print 5 random samples from the combined DataFrame.
* Print the percentage of null values for each feature.
* Check the 5-point summary of the new DataFrame.


_Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):_

* Visualize a heatmap to understand the correlation between features.
* Share insights on the correlation observed.
* Visualize a pairplot with classes distinguished by colors and provide insights.
* Visualize a jointplot for 'P_incidence' and 'S_slope' and share insights.
* Visualize a boxplot to check the distribution of features and share insights.


_Model Building:_

* Split the data into features (X) and target (Y).
* Split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets.
* Train a KNN classifier as a base model.
* Print performance metrics for both training and testing data.
* Experiment with various parameters to improve model performance.
* Showcase improvement achieved and highlight the parameters contributing the most.

**_Part 2: Predicting Potential Customers for Focused Marketing**_


_Data Preparation:_

* Read two datasets, 'Data1' and 'Data2', as separate DataFrames.
* Print the shape, column names, and data types of each DataFrame.
* Merge both DataFrames on the 'ID' feature to create a single DataFrame.
* Change the data type of specific features to 'Object' where required.


_EDA and Data Cleaning:_

* Visualize the distribution of the target variable 'LoanOnCard' and provide insights.
* Check the percentage of missing values and impute if necessary.
* Check for unexpected values in categorical variables and impute with suitable values.


_Model Building and Evaluation:_

* Split the data into features (X) and target (Y).
*  Split the data into 75% training and 25% testing sets.
*  Train a Logistic Regression model as a base model.
*  Print evaluation metrics for the base model and share insights.
*  Balance the data using appropriate techniques.
*  Retrain the Logistic Regression model on the balanced data.
*  Print evaluation metrics for the balanced model and highlight observed differences.


_Model Optimization:_

* Train base models for SVM and KNN.
* Tune parameters for each model as needed and finalize the best-performing model.
* Print evaluation metrics for the final model and share improvement achieved from the base model.

**Conclusion**

Throughout both parts of the project, thorough data exploration, cleaning, and model evaluation are essential to ensure accurate predictions and actionable insights.
